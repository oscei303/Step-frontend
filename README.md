# Step(!!!)

Step(!!!) is a music step sequencer that allows users to save, load, musical patterns by activating a step to generate a sound.

It leverages a custom UI with each channel having unique WaveMunipulation(ATTACK,DECAY,SUSTAIN,RELEASE) along with note selection and wave origin.

Users can load and clear patterns in real time providing a easy to use way to generate melodies!

The top matrix provies a 16 step sequencer that generates synth voices in Tone.js

The bottom matrix is 16 step Drum sequencer that uses tone.js player to trigger drum samples from my own library.

Hope you enjoy it :)

Technologies Used:
